## Part 4: Summary Recommendations

Based on the insights derived from the 2022â€“2023 dataset, here are high-level recommendations aligned with the business goals:

- **Capitalize on Strong Categories:** Invest in Personal Care and Household during Q2 and Q4 as they consistently show peak performance.
- **Enhance Online Experience:** With online revenue outpacing in-store, focus on digital UX, personalization, and exclusive online deals.
- **Refine Membership Strategy:** Convert declining Regular members into VIPs with structured loyalty incentives.
- **Target 18â€“45 Age Group:** Tailor product placements and marketing campaigns toward younger and mid-career consumers who showed the most growth.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9bdca5b-889b-4236-a33e-2e348f6200bd)

### Key Observations:
- **February** marked the lowest performance across both metrics: orders dropped **31.5%** and AOV fell to **$116.93 (-12.3%)**, resulting in the sharpest monthly revenue decline.
- **March to July** showed steady recovery. **July** was particularly strong â€” it had one of the **highest order counts (140)** and also the **highest AOV ($145.60)**, contributing to a secondary revenue peak.
- **November** had the **second-lowest order volume**, but revenue stayed relatively stable thanks to a **significant increase in AOV ($143.78, +30.9%)** â€” indicating customers placed fewer but higher-value orders.

### Recommendations:
- **Stabilize February** with early Q1 promotions or loyalty pushes to avoid simultaneous drops in both volume and value.
- **Leverage high-AOV months** (like **July and November**) to introduce premium product bundles or upsell offers.
- Use insights from **Novemberâ€™s high-AOV behavior** to build **holiday season strategies** that focus on value per customer, even if volume is lower.
- Tailor marketing to monthly AOV patterns â€” deploy **basket-size incentives** during low-AOV periods and focus on **premium promotions** during high-AOV months.

## Part 7: Deep Dive â€“ Product Category Breakdown

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b406f3-a4c0-42ae-893d-cc3d62586bba)

### Key Observations:
In 2023, January recorded the highest monthly revenue, driven by increases across nearly all product categories â€” particularly Personal Care. The only exception was Household, which declined slightly.

In contrast, February experienced the lowest revenue of the year, showing a steep 39.9% drop from January. This was primarily due to sharp declines across all major categories, especially:

- Beverages: â†“ 63.9%  
- Dairy: â†“ 42.4%  
- Snacks: â†“ 47.0%

Revenue recovered strongly in March, increasing by 42% compared to February, mainly due to:

- Beverages: â†‘ 102%  
- Household: â†‘ 81.6%

From March through July, revenue showed a general upward trend, peaking with a spike in May, despite Snacks contributing only 6% of total revenue that month â€” indicating other categories (especially Beverages and Personal Care) drove the growth.

After July, revenue dipped slightly in August, then remained relatively stable through November, before picking up again in December â€” likely reflecting end-of-year consumer activity and holiday demand.

### Recommendations:
